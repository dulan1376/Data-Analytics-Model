#early_stopping_rounds
#early_stopping_rounds offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for n_estimators. Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for n_estimators. It's smart to set a high value for n_estimators and then use early_stopping_rounds to find the optimal time to stop iterating.
#Since random chance sometimes causes a single round where validation scores don't improve, you need to specify a number for how many rounds of straight deterioration to allow before stopping. Setting early_stopping_rounds=5 is a reasonable choice. In this case, we stop after 5 straight rounds of deteriorating validation scores.
#When using early_stopping_rounds, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the eval_set parameter.
my_model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500)
my_model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
             early_stopping_rounds=5,

#learning_rate
#Instead of getting predictions by simply adding up the predictions from each component model, we can multiply the predictions from each model by a small number (known as the learning rate) before adding them in.
#This means each tree we add to the ensemble helps us less. So, we can set a higher value for n_estimators without overfitting. If we use early stopping, the appropriate number of trees will be determined automatically.
#In general, a small learning rate and large number of estimators will yield more accurate XGBoost models, though it will also take the model longer to train since it does more iterations through the cycle. As default, XGBoost sets learning_rate=0.1

#n_jobs
#On larger datasets where runtime is a consideration, you can use parallelism to build your models faster. It's common to set the parameter n_jobs equal to the number of cores on your machine. On smaller datasets, this won't help.
#The resulting model won't be any better, so micro-optimizing for fitting time is typically nothing but a distraction. But, it's useful in large datasets where you would otherwise spend a long time waiting during the fit command.
