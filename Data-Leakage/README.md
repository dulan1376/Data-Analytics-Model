Data leakage (or leakage) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.

In other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.

There are two main types of leakage: target leakage and train-test contamination.

Target leakage occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.

Train-Test ContaminationÂ¶
A different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.

Recall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before. You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior. This is sometimes called train-test contamination.

For example, imagine you run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split(). The end result? Your model may get good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.

After all, you incorporated data from the validation or test data into how you make predictions, so the may do well on that particular data even if it can't generalize to new data. This problem becomes even more subtle (and more dangerous) when you do more complex feature engineering.

If your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of fitting, including the fitting of preprocessing steps. This is easier if you use scikit-learn pipelines. When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!

This accuracy is quite a bit lower, which might be disappointing. However, we can expect it to be right about 80% of the time when used on new applications, whereas the leaky model would likely do much worse than that (in spite of its higher apparent score in cross-validation).

Data leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation. Likewise, a combination of caution, common sense, and data exploration can help identify target leakage.
